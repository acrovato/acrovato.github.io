## DARTFlo
[DARTFlo](https://gitlab.uliege.be/am-dept/dartflo) (Discrete Adjoint for Rapid Transonic Flows, abbreviated as DART) is an open-source C++/python, unstructured finite-element, full potential solver, that I developed at the University of Li√®ge during my Ph.D. thesis, with the active collaboration of [Romain Boman](https://rboman.github.io/).
DART is currently capable of rapidly solving steady inviscid transonic flows on arbitrary configurations, ranging from 2D airfoils to 3D full aircraft, as well as calculating the flow gradients using a discrete adjoint method. Furthemore, the code is interfaced with [CUPyDO](https://github.com/ulgltas/CUPyDO) and [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/), allowing aeroelastic analysis and optimization to be easily carried out. A viscous-inviscid interaction modeling technique is also being implemented so that viscous flows can also be rapidly computed.

## dg-flo
[dg-flo](https://github.com/acrovato/dg-flo) is a small python code implementing the Discontinuous Galerkin method to solve various partial differential equations. I wrote this small demonstrator right after completing my Ph.D. to gain a better understanding of this method, as I find it very elegant and efficient to solve high-fidelity fluid dynamics problems. In the future, I hope to work on a full-scale DG code and apply the method to aircraft design.

## Enroute and Fluttair
When I performed my first solo cross-country flights, I was disapointed not to find a free Android application for Visual Flight Rules flying. Even if using a paper map is an important and required skill to learn, I think that having an app providing the real-time position on a moving map is reasuring for new pilots, and helps to avoid mistakes. This is especially true in Belgium, where the airspace is very crowded. In this regard, I started developing [Fluttair](https://github.com/acrovato/fluttair) towards the end of 2019. It also introduced me to a new type of programming. A few months later, I discovered that [Stefan Kebekus](https://github.com/kebekus) started to develop [Enroute Flight Navigation](https://github.com/Akaflieg-Freiburg/enroute). Due to the difficulty of maintaining up-to-date navigational data without renting a server, I decided to stop the development of Fluttair, and joined the Enroute development team. I initially implemented a few new features, such as the integration of weather information, and I currently help the team with translating the app in French.
